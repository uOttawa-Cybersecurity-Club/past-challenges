# First Event Challenges

## How these challenges work:

Every challenge is some sort of web-app being hosted on our server. You are given the code for each of those apps. 

Each challenge contains a `flag.txt` file which holds something called a flag. Your objective is too find a way to break the functionality of the apps in order to get the contents of the `flag.txt` file. 

Flags look like the following: `CSC{ . . . . some random text . . . . }`

The first three challenges can be solved with Linux knowledge covered in the workshop. 

Feel free to skip any challenges at any time. You do not need to solve them sequentially. 

## How to run the challenges locally:

All challenges should be ran locally in your terminal.

Make sure to run: `pip3 install Flask==2.2.3`

Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file found in each challenge folder. (It's very short)

Note: each challenge also includes a `Dockerfile` if anyone experienced wants to run the challenges using Docker.

## **RULES (IMPORTANT)**:
These challenges are hosted on a server. Therefore, you **cannot** perform a few thing. 

**The following are PROHIBITED:**

* Any form of DDoS or DoS attacks
* Destroying the challenges (If you accidentally break something in the challenge, it's no problem. Let us know and we will reset the challenge.)
* Fork bombs. (This refers to the rule above but I am highlighting it.)
* Any form of ONLINE bruteforcing. You are allowed to perform LOCAL bruteforcing (AS LONG AS NOTHING IS SENT TO THE SERVER).
* Port scanning.
* Breaking out of a challenge's Docker container. 
* Attacking AWS internals (the server we are using is from AWS)
* <u>I WANT TO EMPHASIZE: **If you are not sure whether something you want to do is allowed, PLEASE JUST ASK US BEFORE DOING IT!**</u>

### If you intentionally break any of these rules, you will be asked to leave the event. If you break any of these rules by accident, it's no problem, just let us know and we will get things back up and running swiftly. Accidents happen.

Also, please refrain from using ChatGPT to solve the challenges. You will just be ruining an opportunity for you to learn important concepts in Cybersecurity.
